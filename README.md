# YOLO-Real-Time-Object-Detection-Webcam-
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using a webcam based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The system detects multiple objects in live video and labels them with bounding boxes and class names.  The implementation uses Python and OpenCV's DNN module with pre-trained YOLOv3 weights trained on the COCO dataset.
